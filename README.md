## 📌 Project Description

This data science project series walks through a step-by-step process of building a **Real Estate Price Prediction Website**.

First, we build a machine learning model using **Scikit-Learn** and **Linear Regression** on the **Bangalore Home Prices Dataset** sourced from Kaggle.

In the second step, we create a **Python Flask server** that loads the saved model and serves HTTP requests for price prediction.

The third component is a **web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, where users can input details such as home square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location. The frontend communicates with the Flask backend to retrieve the predicted house price.

During model development, this project covers essential data science concepts such as:
- Data loading and cleaning  
- Outlier detection and removal  
- Feature engineering  
- Dimensionality reduction  
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV  
- Model evaluation using K-Fold Cross Validation
